#Kelley_CSCI2270_FinalProject

**Project Description:**
The water shed on the western slope of Colorado has been depleted over the last century by diversions to the eastern slope. The Moffat Tunnel diversion was the first system, implemented in 1936, and has since been expanded and improved.  It has expanded to such an extent that it is now harming the stream flow in the lower basins on the western slope.  My program will take the flow rate data of Hot Sulfur Springs from 1904 to the present and compare various aspects of the data to see the effect of the diversion. These comparisons will be done through statistical analysis.  The program will take into account outliers and undergo a frequency analysis to determine if the data fits a normal distribution.  It will also compare minimal flow rates for fish and water purification plants to flow rates seen as diversion increases. This analysis will demonstrate the impact of diverting water and assess its effects on overall stream flow.    

**How to Run:**
